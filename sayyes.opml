      <outline text="Framing Principles, Persuasion, Techniques, and Influential Strategies">
        <outline text="People do not necessarily decide what is best for them; they decide what presentation of facts is more attractive" />
        <outline text="Stay in front of potential clients, even after they have said no." />
        <outline text="Talk to clients like they already have your investment, insurance, debt strategy (not if you do this, because you have this)" />
        <outline text="People move away from loss." />
        <outline text="What you say first and last is most important" />
        <outline text="Most people respond or react to the fear of loss and the threat of pain in a much more profound way than they do to the potential for gain." />
        <outline text="Amendment technique – price was this, but now that" />
        <outline text="Price points – just under, 1, 5, 10, 20 , 50, and 100" />
        <outline text="People make emotional decisions and rationalize them logically" />
        <outline text="People tend to decide on the sure thing even when it doesn’t make sense to do so." />
      </outline>
      <outline text="Applying the Laws of Influence">
        <outline text="Law of reciprocity – when someone gives you something, you immediately respond with a desire to give something back" />
        <outline text="Law of time – people will equate you to people that have come before you">
          <outline text="You must distinguish yourself from them" />
          <outline text="Move them from past time to present or future time" />
        </outline>
        <outline text="Order">
          <outline text="Tell them that you’re going to show them a few options" />
          <outline text="People are likely to buy what they are shown second" />
          <outline text="Client will take the least expensive item if it’s shown last" />
        </outline>
        <outline text="Be eager to point out any negative aspects of your proposal.  This makes you appear much more trustworthy,, and allows your clients to be at ease bc you’re doing the legwork in identifying the drawbacks of the proposal." />
        <outline text="When someone announces in writing to take a stance, he’ll defend that stance to the death [give them pen and have them circle it]" />
        <outline text="Your client must be made aware that something about you, service, or product is scarce." />
      </outline>
      <outline text="The influential secret of oscillation">
        <outline text="Yes is not s true decision – it’s an agreement at a particular instant in time; you have to seize it at that moment" />
      </outline>
      <outline text="Mind reading – how to know what they are thinking">
        <outline text="When people get their minds set on something, they want it now." />
      </outline>
      <outline text="I’ll think about it">
        <outline text="At the unconscious level most people perceive every change from the status quo as a threat to their very survival" />
        <outline text="Someone’s feelings will challenge all of your persuasive communication" />
        <outline text="No is a reaction">
          <outline text="The unconscious mind doesn’t think or make decisions.  By definition is can’t and never will.  It reacts in the way it immediately sees the environment and avoids the greatest fear and pain." />
          <outline text="As for the unknown, it’s rarely a better option than the status quo, unless that status quo is enormously painful" />
        </outline>
        <outline text="The best way to get pas no is to not hear it in the first place.  You’ll use alpha and omega strategies.  You must win over the subc and c." />
        <outline text="You must point out both possible futures to be successful.  Otherwise, the person will be destined to go with what they feel, instead of what makes sense." />
        <outline text="When people have the opportunity to reverse their decision, they tend to be less satisfied with their decision later" />
        <outline text="Never let someone feel stupid about past mistakes.  Make sure they know any intelligent person would have done the same thing if they were presented with a similar situation." />
        <outline text="If someone has said no to a profitable opportunity before, it’s very unlikely they’ll say yes when asked again.">
          <outline text="To avoid place a flag.  At that time you sounded like you were interested in sitting down, but because you were so caught up you didn’t have the 30 minutes to spare." />
