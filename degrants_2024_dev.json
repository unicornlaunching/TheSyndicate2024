As a creator, once you sell an Ordinal, you lose connection with it. If this Ordinal appreciates 10x in the secondary market, there are no incentives for the creator.  We're developing Supercharged Bitcoin-native digital assets For Collectors: Purchase an Ordinal once and start earning passive monthly yields in Bitcoin (non-custodial). Profit without the need to sell or trade. For Creators: Make a single sale and enjoy passive monthly yields in Bitcoin. If your asset experiences a 10x increase in secondary sales, your yields will rise accordingly.  Instantly borrow with no interest payments and easily enhance your profitability with self-repaying loans. Bid farewell to high interest costs.",

        "Project Description": "Gecko addresses the lack of security tooling in the Stacks ecosystem, where the only solution is manual audits that are expensive, infrequent and often incomplete. Gecko currently offers an OSS automated security solution using static analysis. This proposal aims to expand on Gecko by implementing dynamic analysis testing using a fully automated fuzzer guided by LLMs. This enhancement will overcome the limitations of static analysis, providing deeper code coverage and the ability to detect novel and business logic vulnerabilities.  Users simply provide either the deployed smart contract address or code, and Gecko Fuzz autonomously generates exploits and remediations when vulnerabilities are found, eliminating the need for manually writing invariants or specifying input generation strategies. This upgrade will ensure Clarity contracts are secured at the speed and scale necessary for the growing Stacks ecosystem.",
        "Elevator Video Pitch (Optional)": "A gecko is a small lizard that crawls around and eats bugs; similarly, Gecko Fuzz is a fuzzer that crawls through your code to find bugs. It lowers the barrier for security testing of Clarity contracts, making regular and thorough security assessments accessible to both individual developers and large teams. Gecko Fuzz is a novel tool that combines formal verification (concolic execution) with fuzzing algorithms guided by dataflow patterns and LLM comparisons to find on-chain smart contract vulnerabilities with no manual effort. Users do not need to write invariants or specify input generation strategies, as Gecko autonomously generates exploits when vulnerabilities are found.",
        "Impact": "- Project Focus and Impact:\n\t- Gecko will be the first security tool in the Stacks ecosystem, addressing the lack of scalable security solutions.\n\t- It will contain a database of vulnerabilities and remediations, offering real-life examples to guide developers in best practices for Clarity contract development.\n\t- Gecko will reduce pre-deployment security barriers, helping developers understand attack surfaces and focus audits, thereby lowering costs and improving coverage.\n- Target Audience and Strategy:\n\t- Targeting Stacks developers through community engagement, social media channels and partnerships.\n- Project Activities:\n\t- Full-Time Development: Funding will support dedicated development resources to enhance Gecko.\n\t- Research and Development: Innovating with new approaches to dynamic analysis security testing for Clarity contracts.\n- Outputs and Broader Impact:\n\t- Providing a comprehensive automated testing solution that includes code coverage, vulnerability location, and proof of concept exploits with remediations.\n\t- Expanding Gecko's capability to detect new types of vulnerabilities, broadening its applicability beyond DeFi.\n\t- Promoting an open-source, AI-driven framework that encourages continuous improvement and collaboration within the community.\n\t- Offering a scalable, affordable security solution that integrates into CI/CD pipelines, making regular and thorough security assessments accessible to both small developers and large teams.",

See https://github.com/stacks-network/sbtc-docs/issues/27. However, TX2 still makes sense for other tokens like meme coins or wrapped USD.\n\n    Copycats who offer the same service, and we run out of business. However, competition is good for innovation.\n\n    The service receives spam txs that are paid for but fail, and no compensation is received. However, we can improve the verification of received txs and even simulate the execution before sponsoring. \n\n    Stacks 3.0 does not launch. However, then we all will pivot anyway, I guess.\n\n\nObstacles and Implementation Barriers\nThe handling of nonces is challenging for sponsored transaction. However, Stacks 3.0 will bring fast blocks reducing the challenges because nonces are process more quickly. TX2 can also use more than one sponsorship address, e.g. one per request.\n\nThe integration of TX2 with sendstx.com showed that it works. However, the verification of received txs might take more effort than we think. The TX2 will have different verification modules to address challenges for different tx types.\n\nMarket Competition and Impact\nThere is no public sponsorship service available now. There are running some bots in the background that execute txs in the name of users (e.g. bridges).\nTX2 will lower the barrier to enter the Stacks ecosystem.",

This standard will enable developers to create interoperable payment solutions, fostering innovation and adoption across both ecosystems. By providing a unified approach to payment requests, we'll simplify the development process, enhance user experience, and strengthen the connection between Bitcoin and Stacks networks. The project will include comprehensive documentation, reference implementations, and developer tools to encourage widespread adoption.",

Quantitatively, we aim to have at least 5 projects adopt our standard within 6 months of completion. Qualitatively, we expect to simplify cross-chain payments and foster greater interoperability between Bitcoin and Stacks ecosystems.\n\n#### Target Audience and Strategy:\nWe target developers building payment solutions on both Bitcoin and Stacks. Our strategy involves creating clear, developer-friendly documentation, providing sample implementations, and engaging with the developer community through workshops and hackathons.\n\n#### Project Activities and Outputs:\nActivities include developing the standard specification, creating reference implementations, and producing comprehensive documentation. Outputs will be the published standard, open-source code repositories, and developer resources.",

We'll mitigate these through extensive community engagement and rigorous testing and by leaning on existing, well-known payment standards from other areas.\n\n#### Obstacles and Implementation Barriers:\nWe may face challenges in achieving consensus on the standard. We'll overcome this by actively involving key stakeholders from both Bitcoin and Stacks communities in the development process. In addition, the viability of sBTC as a payment option depends on the successful implementation of the Nakamoto and sBTC hardforks.\n\n#### Market Competition and Impact:\nWhile other payment standards exist, none effectively bridge Bitcoin and Stacks. Our standard will fill this gap, enhancing interoperability.",
